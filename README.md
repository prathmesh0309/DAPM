# Wildfire Prediction Model

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a predictive modeling project aimed at enhancing wildfire management and risk assessment strategies. Utilizing advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques, this project seeks to identify patterns, classify wildfire incidents, and predict wildfire intensity with significant accuracy.

## Key Objectives
- **Clustering Wildfire Occurrences:** Employing K-Means and DBSCAN algorithms to reveal underlying patterns based on geographic area and density.
- **Classifying Wildfire Types:** Using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree classifiers to predict wildfire types and confidence levels based on environmental factors.
- **Predicting Wildfire Intensity:** Implementing polynomial regression to forecast the intensity of wildfires as measured by Fire Radiative Power (FRP), enhancing resource allocation and emergency response strategies.

## Data
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, encompasses various attributes of wildfire occurrences, including brightness, geographic location, and other environmental factors. Data preprocessing steps such as normalization and exploratory analysis have been applied to ensure data quality and readiness for modeling.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Main programming language for data analysis and model implementation.
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** Includes Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization.

## Getting Started
To run the models and analyses contained in this repository:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed, along with the necessary libraries mentioned above.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks to view the analysis and model outputs.
